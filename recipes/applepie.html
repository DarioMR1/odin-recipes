    <P>This amazing apple pie recipe belonged to my grandmother.
    I have never seen another one quite like it! It will always 
    be my favorite and has won several first place prizes in local 
    competitions. It makes the perfect dessert for family dinners 
    or during the holidays, topped with whipped cream or ice cream, 
    or alongside a slice of Cheddar cheese.</P>
